# reposnoop
**Analyze data from GitHub repos.**

This is (... going to be ...) a library for drawing data from GitHub in order 
to run some statistical analysis. It is mainly intended to identify repos that are 
relevant in respect to some topic, and analyze them for their degree of dissemination
and wether they're  up to date and well maintained.

### Work in progress

By now this project is under heavy construction. Everything you see here might be non-functional
or contain code or ressources that are not intended to stay here. Just for entertainment see it
[being built here live.](construction_steps.md)

> A place to copy-paste your README.md from

One of the most crucial things in your open source project is the `README.md`
file. This repository has a ready-to-copy-paste template you can use for all
your projects.

## Getting started

Copy the `README-default.md` file for yourself and start editing! At the root of
your project, run:

```shell
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jehna/readme-best-practices/master/README-default.md > README.md
```

The code above fetches the `README-default.md` file from this repository.
Here you should say what actually happens when you execute the code above.

### Initial Configuration

Some projects require initial configuration. How to start the prog:

```shell
atom README.md
```

And again you'd need to tell what the previous code actually does.

## Features

What's all the bells and whistles this project can perform?
* What's the main functionality
* You can also do another thing
* If you get really randy, you can even do this

## Configuration

Here you should write what are all of the configurations a user can enter when
using the project.

## Ressources

Which ressources are used, e.g. libs, APIs ...

#### Argument 1
Type: `String`  
Default: `'default value'`

State what an argument does and how you can use it. If needed, you can provide
an example below.

Example:
```bash
awesome-project "Some other value"  # Prints "You're nailing this readme!"
```

#### Argument 2
Type: `Number|Boolean`  
Default: 100



```shell
git add README.md
git commit -m "Added: README"
git push
```


E.g. if you have a perfect `README.md` for a Grunt project, just name it as
`README-grunt.md`.

Tables work, too.
Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the 
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

    Markdown | Less | Pretty
    --- | --- | ---
    *Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
    1 | 2 | 3


some kind of `strikethrough.txt` for file names

run stuff in shell (command line):

```shell
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jehna/readme-best-practices/master/README-default.md > README.md
```

## Starting over: First week.
Here are
some of the tasks:

<details>
    <summary>Example #1 (click!)</summary>

        source code
        source code
        source code

</details>

Easily make a list:
* just put stars at
* the beginning of the line
* and it will magically format itself
