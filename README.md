# reposnoop
**Analyze data from GitHub repos.**

This is (... going to be ...) a library for drawing data from GitHub in order
to run some statistical analysis. It is mainly intended to identify repos that are
relevant in respect to some topic, and analyze them for their degree of dissemination
and wether they're  up to date and well maintained.

### Work in progress

By now this project is under heavy construction. Everything you see here might be non-functional
or contain code or ressources that are not intended to stay here. Just for entertainment see it
[being built here live.](construction_steps.md)
